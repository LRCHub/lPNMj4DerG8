It ain't about a heart to find
It's about the one inside
It's about the love you hide
It's waitin' to be let outside

And it ain't about losing your mind (Oooh)
But if you happen to, that's fine (Oooh)
But theres only one way to shine (Oooh)
And it's called trying

To live
Freely, freely lo coração
Freely, freely lo coração
I'd like to live that way
I'd like to live that way

And my mother may not understand (Oooh)
Why I'm the way that I am (Oooh)
But I love her and I wanna let her in (Do you love her?)
Get to know a friend

And now we gotta take some time (Oooh)
Get to know each other our whole lives (Oooh)
And I call on you to remind (Oooh)
Nothing's really mine

Except for
Freedom, freedom en lo coração
Freedom, Freedom en lo coração
I'd like to live that way
Oh, I'd wanna stay, stay that way

You ever seen anything as kind?
As the wind blowing by?
I've never seen anything as wise
As the sunrise

That shines
Freely, freely en lo coração
Freely, freely lo coração
I'd like to live that way
Ohh, I'd wanna live that way
